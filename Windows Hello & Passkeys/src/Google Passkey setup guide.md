# Google Passkey Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ What is a Passkey?

A passkey is a modern, secure way to sign in to an account (In this case, your Google account) without using a password. It uses your device's built-in security (like Windows Hello, fingerprint, or Face ID) for fast, phishing-resistant sign-in.

  - If you have not set up Windows Hello, please follow our [Windows Hello quick start guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IDZZE9LnLA8hw7besG9ZPunYulGDfgy_/view?usp=sharing).

## üí° Tips

- Passkeys are device and site/platform specific.
  - You'll need to create a new passkey on each device and site/platform you would like to use passkeys on.
  - You will still be able to sign in with other methods such as a password + 2FA code.
- You can remove old passkeys from your Google account at [g.co/passkeys](https://g.co/passkeys).
- Passkeys are more secure than passwords and protect you from phishing.
- You can use a passkey on many sites, not just Google. To find out if a site / platform uses passkeys, please check out [Passkeys.Directory](https://passkeys.directory/) and search for the site / platform in question.
