# Try Windows Hello and Google Passkeys for Faster, Safer Sign-Ins

**Subject:** Try Windows Hello and Google Passkeys for faster, safer sign-ins

Hi team,

We just published two quick-start guides that walk you through setting up Windows Hello and Google Passkeys in under five minutes. These tools make signing in faster and add an extra layer of protection against phishing.

Here is how to get started:

1. Open the Windows Hello quick-start guide and follow the PIN and biometric setup steps.
2. Once Windows Hello is enabled, open the Google Passkey quick-start guide to create a passkey tied to your device.
3. Test both features by locking your screen and signing back into Google—no password required.

Need the guides? They are saved in the Windows Hello & Passkeys folder, and the PDFs are ready to download or print for offline use.

Why this matters:

- Faster sign-ins with Windows Hello biometrics
- Passwordless authentication with Google Passkeys
- Built-in phishing resistance for your Google Workspace account

Questions or need a hand? Contact Joey Maffiola at 650-581-4478 or KMS at 650-581-4500.

Thanks for giving these modern sign-in options a try!

Best regards,
IT Support
